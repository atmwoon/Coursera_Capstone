# IBM Data Science Coursera Capstone Project

### Andrew Woon
**November 2020**

This project contains my submission to the final assignment or the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science). 

The assignment titled "Battle of the Neighborhoods" allows students the freedom to identify and solve any business problem of their choice as long as Foursquare geolocation data is used. My submission focuses on the neighbourhoods (planning areas) of Singapore with the following two main objectives:

1. Identifying a suitable location to live based on proximity to different venues
2. Familiarising with Singapore to know where to start exploring!

The target audience for this analysis is anyone looking to move or visit Singapore (including myself!).

The full analysis notebook is available in this repository, but is advised to be viewed through the `nbviewer` link below, so that the folium 
map visualisations can be rendered:
